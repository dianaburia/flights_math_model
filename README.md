1. Input information
Dataset according to the link that was used in the lab work:
https://www.kaggle.com/leomauro/argodatathon2019
This dataset - information about flights by passenger planes, consists of
three files, I worked with the flights.csv file, where I found 3 required variables,
namely flight price, time and distance between airports. It was also provided
information about the type of flight and to which airport the plane departs.

2. Pre-processing of data
To begin with, let's determine what type of variables is used in the work.
We have scalar quantitative variables because their range of values belongs to
field of real numbers.

We learn what the empirical distribution function looks like for each scalar
variable
