Dataset according to the link that was used in the lab work:
https://www.kaggle.com/leomauro/argodatathon2019
This dataset - information about flights by passenger planes, consists of
three files, I worked with the flights.csv file, where I found 3 required variables,
namely flight price, time and distance between airports. It was also provided
information about the type of flight and to which airport the plane departs.
